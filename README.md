# 📝 React To-Do Application

This is a fully functional **To-Do List Application** built completely by **me — Shubham Mahajan** during my React revision.I created this entire project from scratch to improve my understanding of React concepts such as:

- Components
- State management using `useState`
- Props flow
- React Router v6
- Controlled forms
- Component-based UI architecture

This project is a part of my daily learning, consistency, and revision routine.
