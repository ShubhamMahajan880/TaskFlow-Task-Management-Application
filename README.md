# TaskFlow – Task Management Application

A simple and structured **task management application** built using React.js to understand **component-based UI development, state management, and routing**.

This project was intentionally created as a **transition from frontend fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)** to React-based development.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

TaskFlow was built with a clear learning objective rather than feature overload.

The main goals of this project were:
- To transition from static, DOM-based frontend development to component-driven UI design.
- To understand how React manages UI updates through state.
- To practice breaking UI into reusable components.
- To apply previously learned frontend fundamentals in a modern JavaScript framework.

This project represents a **learning bridge** between core frontend development and React.js.
